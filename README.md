sales-nodejs
============

A sales app made in MongoDB + Express + AngularJS + Node.js

MEAN is a full-stack JavaScript platform designed for web applications. More info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN

This is a simple web application that I would love to have available when I started with Node.js. With this you can see how to use:
* How to use Express framework without rendering (The HTML templates are rendered by AngularJS).
* How to organize you model and routes (API Controllers).
* AngularJS with Node.js as an API Server.
* How to use mongoose and how to define Schemas for MongoDB.
* Using the LESS middleware with Express.

# Installation

After the git clone you should install all the dependencies using the npm command (Node Packaged Modules, this guy will download and install software for you):

    git clone https://github.com/navarroaxel/sales-nodejs.git
    cd sales-nodejs
    npm install

# IDE

I use Sublime Text because is a light text editor and there are package for every language that you want to use.

You can download from here: http://www.sublimetext.com/2.

I sure you want some sugar with your new editor! you can add the packages for all the modules we use here:
* Nodejs Sublime Text 2 Package https://github.com/tanepiper/SublimeText-Nodejs
* AngularJS Sublime Text Package https://github.com/angular-ui/AngularJS-sublime-package
* LESS syntax for Sublime Text https://github.com/danro/LESS-sublime


# Running

When you are ready to run the application you should use:

    node app.js

# MongoDB

If this is your first time with Mongo you can check here http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/ to know how to run Mongo on Windows.

# Coming soon

* Better comments to understand the code
* Unit tests!
