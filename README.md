sales-nodejs
============

A sales app made in node.js + AngularJS + MongoDB

This is a simple web application that I would love to have available when I started with Node.js. With this you can see how to use:
* How to use Express framework without rendering (The HTML templates are rendered by AngularJS).
* How to organize you model and routes (API Controllers).
* AngularJS with Node.js as an API Server.
* How to use mongoose and how to define Schemas for MongoDB.
* Using the LESS middleware with Express.

# Installation

After the git clone you should install all the dependencies using the npm command (Node Packaged Modules, this guy will download and install software for you):

    git clone https://github.com/navarroaxel/sales-nodejs.git
    cd sales-nodejs
    npm install

# Running

When you are ready to run the application you should use:

    node app.js
