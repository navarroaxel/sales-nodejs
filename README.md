sales-nodejs
============

A sales app made in node.js + AngularJS + MongoDB

This is a simple web application that I have desired when I started with node.js. With this you can see how to use:
* How to use Express framework without rendering (The HTML templates are rendered by AngularJS).
* How to organize you model and routes (API Controllers).
* AngularJS with Node.js as an API Server.
* How to use mongoose and how to define Schemas for MongoDB.
* How to use the LESS middleware with express.

# Installation

After the git clone you should install all the dependencies using the npm.
